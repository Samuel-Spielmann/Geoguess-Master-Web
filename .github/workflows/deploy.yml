# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run deploy script
        run:  |
          # abort on errors

          # build
          npm run build

          # navigate into the build output directory
          cd dist

          git init
          git add -A
          git commit -m 'deploy'

          # if you are deploying to https://<USERNAME>.github.io
          git push -f git@github.com:<USERNAME>/<USERNAME>.github.io.git master

          # if you are deploying to https://<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPO>
          # git push -f git@github.com:<USERNAME>/<REPO>.git master:gh-pages

          cd -

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
